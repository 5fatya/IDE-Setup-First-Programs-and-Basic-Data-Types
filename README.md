/*This program performs the division of an integer a by a float b and stores the result in a float variable result.
The printf function outputs the result of the division using %f to format the float.
Comment: The original summary mentioned a correction that is already applied in this code (%f for printf and b is correctly defined as a float).*/

Code Snippet 2
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    float result; /* The result of the division */
    int a = 5;
    float b = 13.5;
    result = a / b;
    printf("The result is %f\n", result); 
    return 0;
}
This program performs the division of an integer a by a float b and stores the result in a float variable result.
The printf function outputs the result of the division using %f to format the float.
Comment: The original summary mentioned a correction that is already applied in this code (%f for printf and b is correctly defined as a float).

Code Snippet 3

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int x = 17, y = 4;
    printf("x=%d\ny=%d\n", x, y);
    printf("sum=%d\n", x + y);
    printf("product=%d\n", x * y);
    printf("difference=%d\n", x - y);
    printf("division=%f\n", (float) x / y);
    printf("remainder of division=%d\n", x % y);
    return 0;
}

This program performs various arithmetic operations on two integers x and y and prints the results.
Operations include addition, multiplication, subtraction, division (with casting to float for accurate division), and modulus (remainder).
Outputs results using printf

code snippet 4

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    int x = 2138;
    printf("x=%9d\n", x);
    float y = -52.358925;
    printf("y=%11.5f\n", y);
    char z = 'G';
    printf("z=%c\n", z);
    double u = 61.295339687;
    printf("u=%.7lf\n", u);
    return 0;
}

This program prints different types of variables with specified formatting.
An integer x is printed with a width of 9.
A float y is printed with a width of 11 and 5 decimal places.
A character z is printed as is.
A double u is printed with 7 decimal places.

code snippet 5

#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
    char c = 'F';
    printf("ASCII code = %d\n", c + 3);
    printf("C Value = %c\n", c + 3);
    return 0;
}

This program demonstrates ASCII value manipulation.
It takes a character c and adds 3 to its ASCII value.
Prints the new ASCII code and the corresponding character value.

Summary:
Each code snippet performs different fundamental operations and demonstrates basic concepts in C programming,
such as arithmetic operations, formatted output using printf, type casting, and ASCII manipulation. 
The snippets highlight how to work with different data types and how to properly format and print output in C.
